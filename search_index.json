yield关键字的作用","keywords":"","body":"1. yield关键字的作用\n题目\n\"yield\"关键字是做什么的？链接\n回答一\n想要理解yield关键字，你必须先理解generators是什么，理解generators之前要先理解iterables.\nIterables\n当你创建一个list，你可以一个个的读其中的元素，一个一个读就叫做iteration：\n>>> mylist = [1, 2, 3]\n>>> for i in mylist:\n...    print(i)\n1\n2\n3\n\n这里的mylist就是一个iterable。当你用一个list，你先创建一个list，这就是一个iterable：\n>>> mylist = [x*x for x in range(3)]\n>>> for i in mylist:\n...    print(i)\n0\n1\n4\n\n任何你使用“for...in...”的地方就是一个iterable；例如lists，strings，files...\n这些iterables使用很方便。因为你可以想读多少读多少，但是你需要把它们都存在内存里面，当你有很多值的时候这样可能就不太好了。\nGenerators\nGenerators也是iterators，是一种只能遍历一遍的iterable，Generators并不把所有值都存在内存里，而是在遍历过程中生成这些值：\n>>> mygenerator = (x*x for x in range(3))\n>>> for i in mygenerator:\n...    print(i)\n0\n1\n4\n\n这个和使用list一样只是你用()而不是[]，只是你不能再次使用形如for i in mygenerator因为它只能被使用一次，它从0开始计算，然后抛弃它再计算1，一个接一个。\nYield\nyield是一个关键字类似return的用法，一个函数使用时会返回一个generator。\n>>> def createGenerator():\n...    mylist = range(3)\n...    for i in mylist:\n...        yield i*i\n...\n>>> mygenerator = createGenerator() # create a generator\n>>> print(mygenerator) # mygenerator is an object!\n\n>>> for i in mygenerator:\n...     print(i)\n0\n1\n4\n\n当你知道你的函数会返回很多数据，并且你知道你仅仅需要读取一次这些值的时候，这么用很方便。\n想要掌握yield，你需要明白当你调用这个函数的时候，你写的代码并没有实际地在run，而只是返回了一个generator的对象，这里有一些tricky。\n然后，你的代码会在每一次for循环使用这个generator的时候run起来。\n接下来，最难的部分：\n当for循环第一次调用这个generator的时候，你的代码会从最开始运行，直到yield语句，然后他会返回这个循环的第一个值。然后每一次调用，都会再一次运行这个function并且返回下一个值，直到没有值可以返回。\n一旦这个function运行到再也不会hit yield语句，这个generator会被视为空，因为这个时候循环结束了，或者你不满足你的if else语句了。\n  geekcircle              updated 2018-06-20 23:54:27

什么是元类（metaclass）\n题目\n什么是元类，我们用它来干什么？链接\n回答一\n1）类作为对象\n在理解元类之前，你需要掌握Python中的类(class)。对于类是什么，Python有独特的看法，这借鉴于Smalktalk。\n在大部分语言中，类仅仅是描述如何去产生一个对象的代码片段，在Python中也一样。\n>>> class ObjectCreator(object):\n...       pass\n...\n\n>>> my_object = ObjectCreator()\n>>> print(my_object)\n\n\n但是类在Python中不仅仅是这样，类也是对象。\n当你使用关键字class时，Python执行它并创建了一个对象。这个语句\n>>> class ObjectCreator(object):\n...       pass\n...\n\n在内存中创建了一个名为“ObjectCreator”的对象。\n\n这个对象（这个类）本身是能够创建对象（实例）的，这也是称之为类的原因。\n\n但是，它仍然是一个对象，因此：\n\n你可以把它赋值给一个变量；\n你能复制它；\n你能给它添加属性；\n你能将它作为一个函数参数传递。\n\n例如：\n>>> print(ObjectCreator) # you can print a class because it's an object\n\n>>> def echo(o):\n...       print(o)\n...\n>>> echo(ObjectCreator) # you can pass a class as a parameter\n\n>>> print(hasattr(ObjectCreator, 'new_attribute'))\nFalse\n>>> ObjectCreator.new_attribute = 'foo' # you can add attributes to a class\n>>> print(hasattr(ObjectCreator, 'new_attribute'))\nTrue\n>>> print(ObjectCreator.new_attribute)\nfoo\n>>> ObjectCreatorMirror = ObjectCreator # you can assign a class to a variable\n>>> print(ObjectCreatorMirror.new_attribute)\nfoo\n>>> print(ObjectCreatorMirror())\n\n\n2）动态地创建类\n因为类是对象，你能动态地创建它们，就像其他对象一样。\n首先，你可以在一个函数中使用class创建一个类。\n>>> def choose_class(name):\n...     if name == 'foo':\n...         class Foo(object):\n...             pass\n...         return Foo # return the class, not an instance\n...     else:\n...         class Bar(object):\n...             pass\n...         return Bar\n...\n>>> MyClass = choose_class('foo')\n>>> print(MyClass) # the function returns a class, not an instance\n\n>>> print(MyClass()) # you can create an object from this class\n\n\n但是这不够动态，因为你仍然需要去完整地定义这个类。\n因为类是对象，它们肯定能用其他方式生成。\n当你使用class这个关键字时，Python自动创建了这个对象。但是正如在Python中做的大部分事情一样，Python同样提供了手动触发的方式。\n还记得函数type吗？一个古老而又有用的函数，能够让你知道一个对象的类型是什么。\n>>> print(type(1))\n\n>>> print(type(\"1\"))\n\n>>> print(type(ObjectCreator))\n\n>>> print(type(ObjectCreator()))\n\n\ntype还有一个完全不同的功能，它也动态地创建对象。type能够接受一个类的描述作为参数，然后返回一个类。\ntype可以这样用：\ntype(name of the class,\n     tuple of the parent class (for inheritance, can be empty),\n     dictionary containing attributes names and values)\n\n例如：\n>>> class MyShinyClass(object):\n...       pass\n\n能用这种方式手动创建。\n>>> MyShinyClass = type('MyShinyClass', (), {}) # returns a class object\n>>> print(MyShinyClass)\n\n>>> print(MyShinyClass()) # create an instance with the class\n\n\n你将注意到，我们使用”MyShinyClass“作为这个类的名称，同样作为变量的名称，并将类引用赋值给它。它们可能有点区别，但是没必要把事情搞复杂。\ntype接受一个字典去定义类的属性，因此：\n>>> class Foo(object):\n...       bar = True\n\n能这样表达\n>>> Foo = type('Foo', (), {'bar':True})\n\n而且被用来作为一个普通的类。\n>>> print(Foo)\n\n>>> print(Foo.bar)\nTrue\n>>> f = Foo()\n>>> print(f)\n\n>>> print(f.bar)\nTrue\n\n当然，你也能继承它，因此：\n>>>   class FooChild(Foo):\n...         pass\n\n等价于\n>>> FooChild = type('FooChild', (Foo,), {})\n>>> print(FooChild)\n\n>>> print(FooChild.bar) # bar is inherited from Foo\nTrue\n\n最终，你需要添加给这个类添加一些方法。仅需要定义好函数，并将它赋值给一个属性即可。\n>>> def echo_bar(self):\n...       print(self.bar)\n...\n>>> FooChild = type('FooChild', (Foo,), {'echo_bar': echo_bar})\n>>> hasattr(Foo, 'echo_bar')\nFalse\n>>> hasattr(FooChild, 'echo_bar')\nTrue\n>>> my_foo = FooChild()\n>>> my_foo.echo_bar()\nTrue\n\n而且，甚至在类动态创建之后，你也能添加更多的方法，就像给一个普通创建的类对象添加方法一样。\n>>> def echo_bar_more(self):\n...       print('yet another method')\n...\n>>> FooChild.echo_bar_more = echo_bar_more\n>>> hasattr(FooChild, 'echo_bar_more')\nTrue\n\n如你所见：在Python中，类也是对象，而且你能动态地创建一个类。\n这就是当你使用class这个关键字时Python所做的，Python使用元类来完成这项工作。\n3）什么是元类\n元类就是我们创建对象的东东。\n你定义一个类是为了创建对象，对吗？\n但是刚才我们了解到了Python类也是对象。\n元类是创建这些对象的东东。他们是类的类，你可以用这种方式去描述它。\nMyClass = MetaClass()\nmy_object = MyClass()\n\n我们已经看到了type能让你像这样做。\nMyClass = type('MyClass', (), {})\n\n这是因为type这个函数事实上是一个元类。type是Python在背后用来创建所有类的元类。\n现在你可能想知道，为什么type首字母要小写，而不是写成Type\n我猜，这与语言一致性有关，例如str是创建字符串对象的类，int是创建整数对象d的类，type就是用来创建类对象的类。\n你可以检查__class__属性看到。\n在Python中一切皆对象。包括整数、字符串、函数和类。它们都是对象，而且它们都是由类产生的。\n>>> age = 35\n>>> age.__class__\n\n>>> name = 'bob'\n>>> name.__class__\n\n>>> def foo(): pass\n>>> foo.__class__\n\n>>> class Bar(object): pass\n>>> b = Bar()\n>>> b.__class__\n\n\n现在，如何__class__的__class__是什么呢？\n>>> age.__class__.__class__\n\n>>> name.__class__.__class__\n\n>>> foo.__class__.__class__\n\n>>> b.__class__.__class__\n\n\n因此，元类就是创建类对象的东东。\n如果你愿意，可以称它为\"类工厂\"。\ntype是Python使用的内置的元类，当然，你也能创建自己的元类。\n4）__metaclass__ 属性\n当你定义一个类时，可以添加一个__metaclass__属性。\nclass Foo(object):\n    __metaclass__ = something...\n    [...]\n\n如果你这样做的话，Python将使用这个元类去创建类Foo\n小心，这有陷阱。\n你首先写了class Foo(object)，但是这个类对象Foo在内存中并没有被创建。\nPython将在类定义中寻找__metaclass__如果Python发现了它，Python将使用它去创建类对象Foo，如果没有，Python将使用type去创建这个类。\n重温几次。\n当你定义：\nclass Foo(Bar):\n    pass\n\nPython将做以下事情：\n在Foo中有__metaclass__属性吗？\n如果有，就使用__mataclass__中定义的东东在内存中创建类对象，类名为Foo。\n如果Python没有找到__metaclass__属性，它将在MODULE层寻找一个__metaclass__，去做相同的事情（对于类，不继承任何东西，基础的老式类）。\n然后如果Python不能找到任何的__metaclass__，它将使用Bar（第一个父类）自己的元类（可能是type）去创建类对象。\n这里小心__metaclass__属性将不会被继承，父类的元类（Bar.__class__）会被继承。如果Bar使用了一个用type（不是type.__new__()）创建Bar的__metaclass__属性，那么它的子类将会继承这个行为。\n现在最大的问题是，你能在__metaclass__中定义什么？\n答案就是，能够创建类的东东。\n什么能创建类呢？type，或者它的子类，或者用了它的任何东西。\n5）自定义元类\n元类的主要目的是为了创建时自动地改变类。\n经常为了API这么做，API中需要创建类去匹配当前的上下文。\n想象一个非常蠢的例子，你决定你的模块中的所有类它们的属性应该大写。有好几种方式可以完成这件事，其中一种方式就是在模块层设置__metaclass__。\n使用这种方式，模块内所有的类都会使用这个元类创建，而且我们必须告诉元类要将所有的属性转为大写。\n幸运的是，__metaclass__确实是可调用的，它不需要是一个正式的类（在名字中带有类，但是不必要是一个类，区分一下，但是这很有用）。\n接下来我们使用函数写个简单的例子。\n# coding=utf-8\n# 适用于python2\n# 元类将自动获取到相同的你经常传给`type`的参数。\n# 即参数列表与`type`的一致。\ndef upper_attr(future_class_name, future_class_parents, future_class_attr):\n    \"\"\"\n      将属性名转为大写后，返回一个类对象。\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 筛选出所有不以__开头的属性，转为大写。\n    uppercase_attr = {}\n    for name, val in future_class_attr.items():\n        if not name.startswith('__'):\n            uppercase_attr[name.upper()] = val\n        else:\n            uppercase_attr[name] = val\n\n    # 使用type创建类\n    return type(future_class_name, future_class_parents, uppercase_attr)\n\n__metaclass__ = upper_attr # 这将影响这个模块内的所有类。\n\nclass Foo(): # 虽然全局的 __metaclass__ 对 “object”无效\n    # 但是我们可以在这里定义 __metaclass__ 而不是仅仅影响这个类。\n    # 这将影响“object”的children\n    bar = 'bip'\n\nprint(hasattr(Foo, 'bar'))\n# Out: False\nprint(hasattr(Foo, 'BAR'))\n# Out: True\n\nf = Foo()\nprint(f.BAR)\n# Out: 'bip'\n\n现在，我们用一个真实的类作为元类去做相同的事情。\n# coding=utf-8\n# 记住`type`事实上是一个类似于`str`和`int`的类\n# 所以你能继承它\nclass UpperAttrMetaclass(type):\n    # __new__ 方法在 __init__ 前执行，这个方法创建对象并返回。\n    # __init__方法仅仅初始化作为参数传入的对象。\n    # 你很少使用__new__方法，除非你想控制类是如何创建的。\n    # 这里创建的对象是一个类，我们想自定义它，因此需要覆盖 __new__。\n    # 你也能在__init__中做一些事情，如果愿意的话。\n    # 一些高级用法还包括覆盖__call__方法，这里不使用。\n    def __new__(upperattr_metaclass, future_class_name,\n                future_class_parents, future_class_attr):\n\n        uppercase_attr = {}\n        for name, val in future_class_attr.items():\n            if not name.startswith('__'):\n                uppercase_attr[name.upper()] = val\n            else:\n                uppercase_attr[name] = val\n\n        return type(future_class_name, future_class_parents, uppercase_attr)\n\n事实上这并不OOP，我们直接调用了type函数，没有覆盖或者是调用父类的__new__，改一下：\n# coding=utf-8\nclass UpperAttrMetaclass(type):\n\n    def __new__(upperattr_metaclass, future_class_name,\n                future_class_parents, future_class_attr):\n\n        uppercase_attr = {}\n        for name, val in future_class_attr.items():\n            if not name.startswith('__'):\n                uppercase_attr[name.upper()] = val\n            else:\n                uppercase_attr[name] = val\n\n        # 重用了type.__new__方法，这种写法是OOP的\n        return type.__new__(upperattr_metaclass, future_class_name,\n                            future_class_parents, uppercase_attr)\n\n你可能注意到额外的参数upperattr_metaclass，这没什么特别的：__new__方法总是接受定义的类作为第一个参数，就像普通方法接受实例作为第一个参数传入self，类方法传入定义类一样。\n当然，为了可读性，我在这里使用的名字太长了。但是就如self一样，所有的参数都有约定俗成的名字，因此一个真实的正式的metaclass应该像这样写：\nclass UpperAttrMetaclass(type):\n\n    def __new__(cls, clsname, bases, dct):\n\n        uppercase_attr = {}\n        for name, val in dct.items():\n            if not name.startswith('__'):\n                uppercase_attr[name.upper()] = val\n            else:\n                uppercase_attr[name] = val\n\n        return type.__new__(cls, clsname, bases, uppercase_attr)\n\n我们使用super让代码看上去更清晰一些，\nclass UpperAttrMetaclass(type):\n\n    def __new__(cls, clsname, bases, dct):\n\n        uppercase_attr = {}\n        for name, val in dct.items():\n            if not name.startswith('__'):\n                uppercase_attr[name.upper()] = val\n            else:\n                uppercase_attr[name] = val\n\n        return super(UpperAttrMetaclass, cls).__new__(cls, clsname, bases, uppercase_attr)\n\n以上就是全部了，关于元类已经没有什么内容了。\n使用元类的代码复杂的原因并不在于元类本身，而是因为你经常使用元类去做一些扭曲的事情，操纵继承，遍历属性（vars）例如__dict__等等。\n事实上，元类在做一些黑科技时非常有用，因此往往是一些复杂的东西。但是就元类本身而言，是简单的。\n\n拦截类的创建。\n修改类。\n返回修改后的类。\n\n6）为什么使用元类时用类而不用函数？\n因为__metaclass__能够接受任何可调用的东西，为什么要去使用明显更为复杂的类呢？\n这么做有几个原因：\n\n目的更明确，当你阅读UpperAttrMetaclass(type)，你知道接下来会发生什么。\n更OOP。元类能够继承元类，覆盖父类的方法。元类甚至能使用元类。\n一个类的子类可以是它的元类的实例如果你指定了一个元类类（metaclass-class），而不是一个元类函数（metaclass-function）。\n能更好地组织代码。你从来没有像上面的例子这样试验性地使用元类。元类经常用于一些复杂场景。为了代码可读性，将好几个方法组织在一个类中的能力是非常重要的。\n你能覆盖__new__，__init__和__call__，这些方法将允许你做不同的事情。即时即经常只需要修改__new__，一些人觉得使用__init__更舒服。\n它们被称为元类，实际就应该和它的名称一致。\n\n7）为什么使用元类\n现在最大的问题，为什么要使用这么晦涩的容易出错的特性？\n通常不要用：\n\n元类是深魔法，99%的用户都不需要关心它。如果你在想是否需要它们，就不要用（需要元类的人确切地知道需要它，无需解释）。\nPython Guru Tim Peters\n\n元类主要的使用场景是创建API，一个典型的例子是Django的ORM。\n它允许你去这样定义：\nclass Person(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=30)\n    age = models.IntegerField()\n\n但是如果你这样做：\nguy = Person(name='bob', age='35')\nprint(guy.age)\n\n它将不会返回一个IntegerFiled对象，它将返回一个int，而且甚至直接传给数据库。\n这是可能的，因为models.Model定义了__metaclass__而且进行了一些特殊处理，将你刚刚简单几句话定义的Person转变为数据库字段的复杂钩子。\nDjango通过使用元类暴露简单的API，让一些复杂的事情看上去简单，通过这些API背后重新创建代码去做真实的事情。\n8）最后一点\n首先，你知道类是能够创建实例的对象。\n事实上，类本身就是对象，元类也是。\n>>> class Foo(object): pass\n>>> id(Foo)\n142630324\n\nPython中一切皆对象，而且他们也是类的实例或类的实例。\n除了type\ntype确实是自己的元类，这只用Python是产生不了的，这是在实现层面做的。\n第二，元类是复杂的。你可能想去使用他们去做简单的类修改。你能使用2种其他的技术去做这件事。\n\n猴子补丁（monkey patching）\n类装饰器（class decorators）\n\n类修改99%的场景适合以上方式。\n但是98%的场景，根本不需要去修改类。\n9）Python3补充\nPython3和Python2中元类使用有区别。\n以下是使用元类实现追踪类定义顺序的例子。\nclass MyMeta(type):\n\n    counter = 0\n\n    def __init__(cls, name, bases, dic):\n        type.__init__(cls, name, bases, dic)\n        cls._order = MyMeta.counter\n        MyMeta.counter += 1\n\nclass MyType(object):              # Python 2\n    __metaclass__ = MyMeta\n\nclass MyType(metaclass=MyMeta):    # Python 3\n    pass\n\nPython3中元类有2个关键的方法。\n\n__prepare__\n__new__\n\n__prepare__让你提供一个自定义的字典（例如OrderedDict）作为元类创建时的命名空间。无论选择什么命名空间，都必须返回一个实例。如果没有实现__prepare__，将会使用一个普通的dict。\nclass Meta(type):\n\n    def __prepare__(metaclass, cls, bases):\n        return dict()\n\n    def __new__(metacls, cls, bases, clsdict):\n        return super().__new__(metacls, cls, bases, clsdict)\n\n回答二\n元类是类的类。就像一个类定义了类的一个实例的行为，一个元类定义了一个类的行为。类是元类的实例。\n\n在Python中，你可以使用任意的可调用的元类(如Jerub的回答)，更有用的方法实际上是使它本身成为一个实际的类。类型（type）是Python中常用的元类。正如你所想的那样，type本身就是一个类，它是它自己的类型。你将无需在Python中重新创建类似于type的东西，但是Python有一点有一定的欺骗性。要在Python中创建自己的元类，你实际上只需要子类化type。\n元类通常用作类工厂。就像你通过调用类创建类的实例一样，Python通过调用元类创建一个新类(当它执行“类”语句时)。与常用的__init__和__new__方法相结合，元类允许你在创建类时做“额外的事情”，比如注册新的类和一些注册表，甚至完全替换类。\n在执行class语句时，Python首先将class语句的主体作为正常的代码块执行。由此产生的命名空间(一个命令)包含将呈现的类的属性。元类是通过查看将呈现的类的基类(元类继承的)，在其__metaclass__属性(如果有)或__metaclass__全局变量来确定的。然后使用类的名称、基础和属性调用元类来实例化它。\n然而，元类实际上定义了类的类型，而不仅仅是它的工厂，因此你可以与它们做更多的事情。例如，你可以在元类上定义常规方法。这些元类方法类似于类方法，因为它们可以在没有实例的类上调用它们，但是它们也不像类方法，因为它们不能在类的实例上调用它们。__subclasses__()是在type元类上的一个方法的例子。你还可以定义普通的“魔术”方法，例如__add__、__iter__和__getattr__，以实现或更改类的行为。\n下面是一些零碎的例子:\ndef make_hook(f):\n    \"\"\"Decorator to turn 'foo' method into '__foo__'\"\"\"\n    f.is_hook = 1\n    return f\n\nclass MyType(type):\n    def __new__(mcls, name, bases, attrs):\n\n        if name.startswith('None'):\n            return None\n\n        # Go over attributes and see if they should be renamed.\n        newattrs = {}\n        for attrname, attrvalue in attrs.iteritems():\n            if getattr(attrvalue, 'is_hook', 0):\n                newattrs['__%s__' % attrname] = attrvalue\n            else:\n                newattrs[attrname] = attrvalue\n\n        return super(MyType, mcls).__new__(mcls, name, bases, newattrs)\n\n    def __init__(self, name, bases, attrs):\n        super(MyType, self).__init__(name, bases, attrs)\n\n        # classregistry.register(self, self.interfaces)\n        print \"Would register class %s now.\" % self\n\n    def __add__(self, other):\n        class AutoClass(self, other):\n            pass\n        return AutoClass\n        # Alternatively, to autogenerate the classname as well as the class:\n        # return type(self.__name__ + other.__name__, (self, other), {})\n\n    def unregister(self):\n        # classregistry.unregister(self)\n        print \"Would unregister class %s now.\" % self\n\nclass MyObject:\n    __metaclass__ = MyType\n\n\nclass NoneSample(MyObject):\n    pass\n\n# Will print \"NoneType None\"\nprint type(NoneSample), repr(NoneSample)\n\nclass Example(MyObject):\n    def __init__(self, value):\n        self.value = value\n    @make_hook\n    def add(self, other):\n        return self.__class__(self.value + other.value)\n\n# Will unregister the class\nExample.unregister()\n\ninst = Example(10)\n# Will fail with an AttributeError\n#inst.unregister()\n\nprint inst +

z被改变，返回值为None\n\n2种方法中，y出现在后面，所以它的值将会覆盖x的值，因此最终的结果，b将会变成3\n没用Python3.5，仍旧想一行搞定\n如果你没有使用Python3.5，或者的确想写向后兼容的代码，同时想一行表达式搞定，最高效正确的方式是写一个函数。\ndef merge_two_dicts(x, y):\n    \"\"\"Given two dicts, merge them into a new dict as a shallow copy.\"\"\"\n    z = x.copy()\n    z.update(y)\n    return z\n\n然后就可以单行搞定了。\nz = merge_two_dicts(x, y)\n\n你也能写一个函数合并不定数量的字典，0到N个字典\ndef merge_dicts(*dict_args):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given any number of dicts, shallow copy and merge into a new dict,\n    precedence goes to key value pairs in latter dicts.\n    \"\"\"\n    result = {}\n    for dictionary in dict_args:\n        result.update(dictionary)\n    return result\n\n这个函数Python2和Python3种都能运行，例如给定从a到g的字典：\nz = merge_dicts(a, b, c, d, e, f, g)\n\ng 中的键值对优先级比 a到f要高，以此类推。\n对其他答案的批评\n不要使用如下的方式\nz = dict(x.items() + y.items())\n\n在Python2中，会在内存中分别为2个字典创建2个列表，然后在内存中创建第3个列表，长度等于前两者之和，然后丢弃这三个列表去创建一个新的字典。在Python3种，这会失败，因为你想合并2个 dict_items，而不是2个列表\n>>> c = dict(a.items() + b.items())\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"\", line 1, in \nTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'dict_items' and 'dict_items'\n\n你需要显式地把它们转换成列表，例如 z = dict(list(x.items()) + list(y.items()))，这是对资源和算力的一种浪费。\n相似的，在Python3中取 items()的并集（Python2.7种的viewitems()）也会失败当值是一些不可哈希的对象时（例如列表）。及时值都是可哈希的，由于集合是无序的，行为取决于集合元素的优先级，因此不要这么做\n>>> c = dict(a.items() | b.items())\n\n这个例子展示了当值是不可hash时会发生什么\n>>> x = {'a': []}\n>>> y = {'b': []}\n>>> dict(x.items() | y.items())\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"\", line 1, in \nTypeError: unhashable type: 'list'\n\n这有一个例子展示了因集合的无序性，导致y的优先级失效，最终的结果保留了x的值。\n>>> x = {'a': 2}\n>>> y = {'a': 1}\n>>> dict(x.items() | y.items())\n{'a': 2}\n\n另一种取巧的方法也不应当使用\nz = dict(x, **y)\n\n这种方法使用了字典的构造函数，非常快，内存占用非常小（仅比最开始的2步的方法多一点）。但是除非你准确地知道将会发生什么（那就是，第二个字典将会作为关键字参数传给字典的构造函数），这很难理解，也不是预期的用法，这不Pythonic。\n这有一个这种用法在django中被纠正的例子。remediated in django\n字典期望接受可哈希的键（例如，不可变集合(frozensets)和元组）,但是这个方法当键不是字符串的时候，在Python3中会失败。\n>>> c = dict(a, **b)\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"\", line 1, in \nTypeError: keyword arguments must be strings\n\n从邮件列表中，Python语言的创始人，Guido van Rossum 写道：\n\n我宣布 dict({}, **{1:3})是非法的，因为它滥用了 ** 的机制\n\n另一句\n\n很明显，dict(x, **y) 比 \"call x.update(y) and return x\"更cool，个人认为比起cool，更despicable（卑鄙）\n\n我的理解（也是语言创始人的理解）：dict(**y)的目的是创建字典时增强可读性的，例如\ndict(a=1, b=10, c=11)\n\n而不是\n{'a': 1, 'b': 10, 'c': 11}\n\n对评论的回复\n\n不管Guido所说，dict(x, y)符合语法规范，而且在Python2和Python3中都能工作，这只适用于键为字符串的原因是关键字参数的工作机制导致的，而不是字典的一种简写机制。在这个地方，使用  操作符也没有滥用机制，实际上 ** 的设计恰恰是为了将关键字传递给字典。\n\n而且，当键不是字符串时，Python3中不工作。隐式的调用约定是命名空间采用普通的字典，用户必须只传递字符串关键字，其他类型都是违背了这一约定的。在Python2中 dict打破了这个一致性。\n>>> foo(**{('a', 'b'): None})\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"\", line 1, in \nTypeError: foo() keywords must be strings\n>>> dict(**{('a', 'b'): None})\n{('a', 'b'): None}\n\n这种不一致性存在于Python的其他实现(Pypy, Jython, IronPython)，在Python3中被修复，因为这可能是个突破性的变化。\n向你指出，故意编写只能在一种语言版本中或者只在特定约束条件下才能工作的代码是无能的体现。\n另外一个评论\n\ndict(x.items() + y.items())在Python2中仍是可读性最强的写法，可读性更重要。\n\n我的回复：对我而言merge_two_dicts(x, y)可读性更好。如果不是前向兼容的问题，Python2将会加速被废弃。\n性能较差但正确的写法\n以下写法性能较差，但是也是正确的方式。比起copy和update方法以及新的展开方法，性能会差跟多，原因是迭代了每一个键值对，但是保证了优先级（后面的字典优先级高）\n你也用一个字典推导中手动合并字典。\n{k: v for d in dicts for k, v in d.items()} #

... 而且可以理解调用\n    print(whisper())\n\n# 每次调用 “talk”，内部声明的 \"whisper\" 也会被调用。\ntalk()\n# 输出: \"yes...\"\n\n# 但是在 \"talk\" 之外，\"whisper\" 并不存在:\n\ntry:\n    print(whisper())\nexcept NameError, e:\n    print(e)\n    # 输出 : \"name 'whisper' is not defined\"*\n    # Python的函数是对象，就像函数内部定义的其他普通对象一样。\n\n函数引用\n接下来就比较有趣了。\n你已经知道了函数是对象，因此函数：\n\n可以被赋值给一个变量。\n可以在另一个函数中定义。\n\n这也意味着，一个函数可以返回另一个函数。\ndef getTalk(kind=\"shout\"):\n\n    #

\"wrapper\"包装了\"func\"\n    # 神奇的事情在这~\n    @functools.wraps(func)\n    def wrapper():\n        print(\"bar\")\n        return func()\n    return wrapper\n\n@bar\ndef foo():\n    print(\"foo\")\n\nprint(foo.__name__)\n# 输出: foo\n\n装饰器用来做什么？\n现在最大的问题，装饰器用来做什么？\n看起来很酷，很强大，但是实用才是王道。当然，这有无数种可能性。经典的用法是用来扩展不能修改的外部库导入的函数的行为，或者为了调试。\n你可以扩展好几个函数的行为，像这样：\ndef benchmark(func):\n    \"\"\"\n    打印花费多少时间的装饰器\n    \"\"\"\n    import time\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        t = time.clock()\n        res = func(*args, **kwargs)\n        print(\"{0} {1}\".format(func.__name__, time.clock()-t))\n        return res\n    return wrapper\n\n\ndef logging(func):\n    \"\"\"\n    打印脚本活动的装饰器\n    \"\"\"\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        res = func(*args, **kwargs)\n        print(\"{0} {1} {2}\".format(func.__name__, args, kwargs))\n        return res\n    return wrapper\n\n\ndef counter(func):\n    \"\"\"\n    打印函数被调用次数的装饰器\n    \"\"\"\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        wrapper.count = wrapper.count + 1\n        res = func(*args, **kwargs)\n        print(\"{0} has been used: {1}x\".format(func.__name__, wrapper.count))\n        return res\n    wrapper.count = 0\n    return wrapper\n\n@counter\n@benchmark\n@logging\ndef reverse_string(string):\n    return str(reversed(string))\n\nprint(reverse_string(\"Able was I ere I saw Elba\"))\nprint(reverse_string(\"A man, a plan, a canoe, pasta, heros, rajahs, a coloratura, maps, snipe, percale, macaroni, a gag, a banana bag, a tan, a tag, a banana bag again (or a camel), a crepe, pins, Spam, a rut, a Rolo, cash, a jar, sore hats, a peon, a canal: Panama!\"))\n\n# 输出:\n# reverse_string ('Able was I ere I saw Elba',) {}\n# wrapper 0.0\n# wrapper has been used: 1x\n# ablE was I ere I saw elbA\n# reverse_string ('A man, a plan, a canoe, pasta, heros, rajahs, a coloratura, maps, snipe, percale, macaroni, a gag, a banana bag, a tan, a tag, a banana bag again (or a camel), a crepe, pins, Spam, a rut, a Rolo, cash, a jar, sore hats, a peon, a canal: Panama!',) {}\n# wrapper 0.0\n# wrapper has been used: 2x\n# !amanaP :lanac a ,noep a ,stah eros ,raj a ,hsac ,oloR a ,tur a ,mapS ,snip ,eperc a ,)lemac a ro( niaga gab ananab a ,gat a ,nat a ,gab ananab a ,gag a ,inoracam ,elacrep ,epins ,spam ,arutaroloc a ,shajar ,soreh ,atsap ,eonac a ,nalp a ,nam A\n\n当前，装饰器的好处还在于如果能够正确使用，可避免重复代码。\n@counter\n@benchmark\n@logging\ndef get_random_futurama_quote():\n    from urllib import urlopen\n    result = urlopen(\"http://subfusion.net/cgi-bin/quote.pl?quote=futurama\").read()\n    try:\n        value = result.split(\"\")[1].split(\"\")[0]\n        return value.strip()\n    except:\n        return \"No, I'm ... doesn't!\"\n\n\nprint(get_random_futurama_quote())\nprint(get_random_futurama_quote())\n\n# outputs:\n# get_random_futurama_quote () {}\n# wrapper 0.02\n# wrapper has been used: 1x\n# The laws of science be a harsh mistress.\n# get_random_futurama_quote () {}\n# wrapper 0.01\n# wrapper has been used: 2x\n# Curse you, merciful Poseidon!\n\nPython 内置了很多装饰器： property, staticmethod，等。\nDjango使用装饰器来管理缓存，视图权限。\n集成内部异步调用。\n装饰器的使用远不止这些。\n  geekcircle              updated 2018-06-22 01:28:32  "},"stackoverflow/18.understanding-pythons-slice-notation.html":{"url":"stackoverflow/18.understanding-pythons-slice-notation.html","title":"18. 理解python的切片符号","keywords":"","body":"18. 理解python的切片符号\n题目\n我需要对Python的切片符号表示有一个很好的解释(有引用更佳)。\n对我来说，这个符号需要一点补充。\n它看起来非常强大，但我还没有完全理解它。\n链接\n回答一\n它真的是非常简单的:\na[start:end] # items start through end-1\na[start:]    # items start through the rest of the array\na[:end]      # items from the beginning through end-1\na[:]         # a copy of the whole array\n\n还有步长(step)值，可用于上述任何一项:\na[start:end:step] # start through not past end, by step\n\n需要记住的关键是:end值表示在选定的片中第一个没有的值。因此，end和start之间的插值表示所选元素的数量(如果步长为1，表示默认)。\n另一个特性是start或end可能是一个负数，这意味着它从数组的末尾而不是开始计数。所以:\na[-1]    # last item in the array\na[-2:]   # last two items in the array\na[:-2]   # everything except the last two items\n\n同样，步长可能是负数:\na[::-1]    # all items in the array, reversed\na[1::-1]   # the first two items, reversed\na[:-3:-1]  # the last two items, reversed\na[-3::-1]  # everything except the last two items, reversed\n\n如果项目比你要求的要少，Python对程序员来说是很好的。例如，如果您要求a[:-2]并且a只包含一个元素，那么您将得到一个空列表而不是一个错误。有时你更喜欢错误，所以你必须意识到这可能发生。\n  geekcircle              updated 2018-09-18 23:20:53  "},"stackoverflow/19.finding-the-index-of-an-item-given-a-list-containing-it-in-python.html":{"url":"stackoverflow/19.finding-the-index-of-an-item-given-a-list-containing-it-in-python.html","title":"19.

Lists\n注意事项\n注意虽然这可能是对所问问题最简单的回答方法，index在list中支持很弱，以下是list.index的注意事项，一开始看下它的文档：\n>>> print(list.index.__doc__)\nL.index(value, [start, [stop]]) -> integer -- return first index of value.\nRaises ValueError if the value is not present.\n\n线性的时间复杂度\n一个index将会按顺序检查列表中的每一个元素，直到找到相匹配的。如果列表很长，而且你不知道大致会出现在列表中的哪个位置，这种搜索方式可能成为瓶颈。这种情况下，你应该考虑另一种数据结构。注意如果你大致直到哪个位置能找到匹配值，你可以给index一个提示。例如，l.index(999_999, 999_990, 1_000_000)比直接使用l.index(999_999)大约快5个数量级，因为前者只需要搜索10个元素，后者将搜索100w个。\n>>> import timeit\n>>> timeit.timeit('l.index(999_999)', setup='l = list(range(0, 1_000_000))', number=1000)\n9.356267921015387\n>>> timeit.timeit('l.index(999_999, 999_990, 1_000_000)', setup='l = list(range(0, 1_000_000))', number=1000)\n0.0004404920036904514\n\n仅仅返回第一个匹配值的索引\n调用index时，搜索整个列表，当找到一个匹配值就会停下来。如果你期望多个匹配的下标，你应该使用推导式或者生成器。\n>>> [1, 1].index(1)\n0\n>>> [i for i, e in enumerate([1, 2, 1]) if e == 1]\n[0, 2]\n>>> g = (i for i, e in enumerate([1, 2, 1]) if e == 1)\n>>> next(g)\n0\n>>> next(g)\n2\n\n大部分我想使用index的地方，现在改用列表推导式或生成器，因为后者更通用。因此当你需要找到index时，可以考虑这些非常棒的Python语言特性。\n元素不存在则抛出异常\n当元素不存在时，调用index将导致ValueError异常。\n>>> [1, 1].index(2)\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"\", line 1, in \nValueError: 2 is not in list\n\n如果元素可能不在列表中，你应该\n\n首先使用item in my_list（简单，可读）检查，或者\n使用try/except包装index的调用，捕获ValueError异常（可能更快，至少要搜索的列表很长而且元素经常是存在的情况下是这样）。\n\n  geekcircle

shell中逐个字符键入来得到等价对象。\n这之后，你可以实现__str__作为用户可读的实例描述，如果你认为这有必要的话。\n__str__\n如果打印一个对象，或者把对象传给format，str.format，如果__str__方法定义了，那么这个方法就会被执行，否则，会执行__repr__。\n__repr__\n内置函数repr会调用__repr__，当你在Python shell中计算一个表达式时，表达式返回的对象在shell中显示为__repr__返回的字符串。\n因为它是__str__的回退，如果你只能写一个，那么久实现__repr__。\n以下是repr函数的内置帮助。\nrepr(...)\n    repr(object) -> string\n\n    Return the canonical string representation of the object.\n    For most object types, eval(repr(object)) == object.\n\n也就是说，对于大部分对象，如果你键入repr打印出来的内容，你应该能够创建一个等价的对象。但是这并不是Python语言默认的实现。\n__repr__的默认实现\n__repr__的默认实现(C Python source) 类似这样：\ndef __repr__(self):\n    return ''.format(\n      self.__module__, type(self).__name__, hex(id(self)))\n\n这意味着默认打印出模块来自哪，类名和内存中的十六进制的位置，例如：\n\n\n这些信息不是很有用，用这些信息也不能够准确地创建出给定的示例，但有总比没有好，至少告诉我们如何在内存中唯一识别它。\n__repr__ 有什么用？\n让我们看看它的用处，使用Python shell和datatime对象，首先我们需要导入datetime模块。\nimport datetime\n\n如果我们在shell中调用datetime.now，我们将看到可以重新创建出等价datetime对象的信息，这就是datetime的__repr__生成的：\n>>> datetime.datetime.now()\ndatetime.datetime(2015, 1, 24, 20, 5, 36, 491180)\n\n如果我们打印一个datetime对象，我们将看到适合人类阅读的（ISO表示）格式，这是由datetime的__str__实现的：\n>>> print(datetime.datetime.now())\n2015-01-24 20:05:44.977951\n\n利用__repr__的信息重新创建出一个对象是非常容易的，然后打印它，我们将得到和上面示例一样的可读性强的输出：\n>>> the_past = datetime.datetime(2015, 1, 24, 20, 5, 36, 491180)\n>>> print(the_past)\n2015-01-24 20:05:36.491180\n\n如何实现它们\n你可能会想如何再次生成相同状态的对象。例如，datetime对象的__repr__（Python source）是如何定义的。很复杂，因为需要重建这一对象的所有属性。\ndef __repr__(self):\n    \"\"\"Convert to formal string, for repr().\"\"\"\n    L = [self._year, self._month, self._day, # These are never zero\n         self._hour, self._minute, self._second, self._microsecond]\n    if L[-1] == 0:\n        del L[-1]\n    if L[-1] == 0:\n        del L[-1]\n    s = \", \".join(map(str, L))\n    s = \"%s(%s)\" % ('datetime.' + self.__class__.__name__, s)\n    if self._tzinfo is not None:\n        assert s[-1:] == \")\"\n        s = s[:-1] + \", tzinfo=%r\" % self._tzinfo + \")\"\n    return s\n\n如果你想让对象可读性更强，接下来可以实现__str__了。下面的示例是datetime对象如何实现__str__，非常简单，因为已经有转换为ISO格式的函数直接调用。\ndef __str__(self):\n    \"Convert to string, for str().\"\n    return self.isoformat(sep=' ')\n\n设__repr__=__str__？\n这种做法是愚蠢的。__repr__是__str__的回退行为，__repr__是为了方便开发者定位问题的，应该在__str__之前实现。\n仅仅当你需要对象的文本表示的时候，才需要实现__str__。\n结论\n为你写的所有对象定义__repr__，这样你或者其他开发者有了重建这个对象的示例。\n当你需要人类可阅读的字符串表示的时候，定义__str__。\n

可变类型\n我们尝试改变传递给方法的列表\ndef try_to_change_list_contents(the_list):\n    print('got', the_list)\n    the_list.append('four')\n    print('changed to', the_list)\n\nouter_list = ['one', 'two', 'three']\n\nprint('before, outer_list =', outer_list)\ntry_to_change_list_contents(outer_list)\nprint('after, outer_list =', outer_list)\n\n输出：\nbefore, outer_list = ['one', 'two', 'three']\ngot ['one', 'two', 'three']\nchanged to ['one', 'two', 'three', 'four']\nafter, outer_list = ['one', 'two', 'three', 'four']\n\n因为传递的参数是outer_list的引用，并不是它的拷贝，我们可以使用改变列表的方法去改变它，并且改变将反应到外部的。\n如果尝试改变作为参数传递的引用呢？\ndef try_to_change_list_reference(the_list):\n    print('got', the_list)\n    the_list = ['and', 'we', 'can', 'not', 'lie']\n    print('set to', the_list)\n\nouter_list = ['we', 'like', 'proper', 'English']\n\nprint('before, outer_list =', outer_list)\ntry_to_change_list_reference(outer_list)\nprint('after, outer_list =', outer_list)\n\n输出：\nbefore, outer_list = ['we', 'like', 'proper', 'English']\ngot ['we', 'like', 'proper', 'English']\nset to ['and', 'we', 'can', 'not', 'lie']\nafter, outer_list = ['we', 'like', 'proper', 'English']\n\n因为the_list参数是按值传递的，把它赋值给一个新列表对外部代码没有影响。the_list是外部outer_list引用的拷贝，我们已经将the_list指向了一个新列表，但是不能改变outer_list的指向。\nString - 不可变类型\n\n不可变类型，不能改变字符串的内容。\n\n尝试改变引用\ndef try_to_change_string_reference(the_string):\n    print('got', the_string)\n    the_string = 'In a kingdom by the sea'\n    print('set to', the_string)\n\nouter_string = 'It was many and many a year ago'\n\nprint('before, outer_string =', outer_string)\ntry_to_change_string_reference(outer_string)\nprint('after, outer_string =', outer_string)\n\n输出：\nbefore, outer_string = It was many and many a year ago\ngot It was many and many a year ago\nset to In a kingdom by the sea\nafter, outer_string = It was many and many a year ago\n\n因为the_string是按值传递的，赋值一个新字符串给它不会对外部的代码产生影响。the_string是out_string引用的拷贝，the_string指向了一个新字符串，但是不能改变out_string的指向。\n如何解决这个问题？\n可以返回新的值，这并不会改变参数传递的方式，但是能够得到希望返回的信息。\ndef return_a_whole_new_string(the_string):\n    new_string = something_to_do_with_the_old_string(the_string)\n    return new_string\n\n# then you could call it like\nmy_string = return_a_whole_new_string(my_string)\n\n如果你确实想避免使用返回值，你可以创建一个包含所需要的值的类，将它传递给方法，就像列表一样。\ndef use_a_wrapper_to_simulate_pass_by_reference(stuff_to_change):\n    new_string = something_to_do_with_the_old_string(stuff_to_change[0])\n    stuff_to_change[0] = new_string\n\n# then you could call it like\nwrapper = [my_string]\nuse_a_wrapper_to_simulate_pass_by_reference(wrapper)\n\ndo_something_with(wrapper[0])\n\n虽然这看起来不够简洁。\n  geekcircle              updated 2018-09-18 23:47:07  "}}}
